# Apple-quality-prediction-with-Deep-Learning

This repository contains a deep learning solution for predicting the quality of apples based on various features and attributes. The goal is to develop a robust model that can assist in determining the quality of apples in an automated and efficient manner.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Models:** Implementations of state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze and predict apple quality.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Robust data preprocessing pipelines to handle cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction from raw apple quality datasets.

- **Model Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation metrics and tools to assess the performance of the trained models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Visualization:** Visualization scripts for displaying model training/validation curves, confusion matrices, and other relevant visualizations to gain insights into the model's behavior.
